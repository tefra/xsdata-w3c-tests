first-generation language for defining data  known as HTML  has led to
the creation of the world s first digital library  Using the simplicity
of HTML with more advanced concepts from the publishing community has
led to the creation of a second-generation Internet language called the
Extensible Markup Language  XML   which is rapidly becoming one of the
most popular languages in the world  XML is being incorporated into web
pages and applications alike  particularly in those involved in
electronic commerce applications  It is a language that describes
information in a way that allows computers to exchange and automatically
act on the information  Consequently  it can be used to automate certain
processes  A set of related technologies built around this Internet
language define a rich set of tools that can be used to define 
manipulate  and display context-rich data  </ns0:NISTSchema-SV-IV-atomic-string-length-2>
